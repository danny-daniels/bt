A Brief introduction to MetaMask
MetaMask is an open-source, straightforward, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet. It functions as a web

token standards. Furthermore, MetaMask benefits include interaction with websites; hence, it can function as 
a connection node for various DApps on Ethereum
